	<h2>Christopher Bass</h2>
		<p>My name is Christopher Bass. I graduated from Western Kentucky University with a bachelors in teaching Physical Education in 2010. Since then I have been substitute teaching 
		and for three of those years I also coached a high school soccer team. While I enjoyed coaching there are not many jobs teaching physical education right now and after substitute 
		teaching in many different subjects I have no desire to teach anything else at the high school level. Which is why I am currently working towards my Masters degree in CIS at 
		Boston University. I have always loved working with computers, and found information security to be very interesting. Although I did find that I don't mind working with databases
		in one of the last classes that I took, so I am keeping an open mind as I take my required core courses. I may find that I enjoy something else more than information security. 
		Hopefully this degree will help me change careers.</p>
	
		<p>I currently live in Louisville with my girlfriend. We have two Siamese cats, both of which are rescue cats. One we found hiding outside in a box of stuffed animals and the other
		we took in from a shelter. I have put a picture of both of them tearing up some tissue paper below. They are very talkative and love to disrupt anything you are trying to do if you
		decide to stay stationary for any length of time. Which makes taking proctor cam tests rather interesting. In my free time I generally play video games, watch TV shows, play soccer
		or basketball, and read. I mostly read fantasy/science fiction books. My favorite authors are Brandon Sanderson, Brent Weeks, Patrick Rothfuss, and Robert Jordan. Although I like 
		and read plenty of other authors as well. I have included my Linkedin and Facebook page links below.</p>
